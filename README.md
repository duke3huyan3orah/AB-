# Project ABτγ

## The Absolutely Bizarre Tau-Gamma Initiative

### What is this?

Project ABτγ is a groundbreaking scientific endeavor dedicated to generating completely random combinations of Greek and Latin letters while presenting them with the gravitas they absolutely do not deserve.

### Features

- **Advanced Letter Mixing Technology**: Combines Greek letters (α, β, γ, τ, etc.) with Latin letters (A, B, C, etc.) using cutting-edge random number generation
- **Scientifically Absurd Facts**: Each combination comes with a completely made-up "fact" that sounds vaguely scientific
- **Color-Changing Display**: Because if your letters aren't changing colors, are you even doing science?
- **Spinning Animation**: Watch in awe as letters rotate into existence
- **Zero Practical Applications**: We're proud to say this has no real-world use cases

### Why does this exist?

Great question. We're still trying to figure that out ourselves.

### Installation

```bash
# Step 1: Question your life choices
# Step 2: Open the file anyway
# Step 3: Click the button repeatedly
# Step 4: Profit??? (No, you won't profit)
```

### Usage

1. Open the application
2. Marvel at the current letter combination
3. Read the completely fabricated "fact"
4. Click "Generate New Combo!" 
5. Repeat until you achieve enlightenment (or boredom)

### Warning

⚠️ **Side effects may include:**
- Uncontrollable urge to learn actual Greek
- Sudden desire to become a mathematician
- Confusion about what you're doing with your life
- Inexplicable satisfaction from randomness
- Strong opinions about font choices for Greek letters

### Contributing

We accept contributions in the form of:
- More ridiculous "facts"
- Additional silly features
- Existential questions about the project's purpose
- Bug reports (though we consider most bugs to be "features")

### License

This project is licensed under the "Why Did I Make This?" License - you're free to use it, share it, laugh at it, or question its existence.

### Acknowledgments

- The ancient Greeks, who had no idea their alphabet would be used for this
- The Romans, ditto
- Everyone who clicked the button more than once
- You, for reading this far

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the point of this?**  
A: Yes.

**Q: Can I use this for my PhD thesis?**  
A: Please don't.

**Q: Is there a mobile version?**  
A: It's responsive, so technically yes. Your phone will be just as confused as your computer.

**Q: What's the computational complexity of the algorithm?**  
A: O(silly)
